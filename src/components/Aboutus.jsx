        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>DevTinder</strong> is a social networking platform built
          exclusively for developers to connect, collaborate, and create.
          Whether you're looking to find a coding buddy, brainstorm side
          projects, or simply meet like-minded devs â€” DevTinder is your space.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Our goal is to break the ice in the developer community by offering a
          modern, swipe-based interface where developers can match based on
          shared interests, skills, and goals. We've also integrated features
          like real-time chat, project posting, and more to help you build
          meaningful developer relationships.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We believe in the power of tech communities. DevTinder helps eliminate
          the isolation that many developers face by providing a platform where
          networking, collaboration, and communication are seamless and fun.
